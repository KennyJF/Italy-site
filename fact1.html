            Pizza was first invented in Naples, Italy. <br>
            In the beginning pizza was an fast, affordable, and tasty meal for working class citizens. <br>
            Unlike the greasy meat covered pizza of the United States, Italy's traditional pizza consisted of <br>
            fresh basil leaves, red tomato sauce, and white Mozarella di Bufala cheese. <br>
