        <p>

            The first civilization in Italy was the Etruscan, which arose about 800 BC in central Italy. <br>
            In 510 BC Rome, which was being ruled by the Etruscans at the time, rebelled. <br>
             The last Etruscan city fell to the Romans in 265 BC. <br>
            Over time the national language of Italy has changed <br>
             but the two biggest languages spoken across the ages are <br>
             Classical Latin spoken by the Romans and Italian spoken by modern day Italy. <br>
            The population of todays Italy is roughly 59 million people. <br>
